This is the source code for the R package "raster". Released versions are on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html).


The easiest way to install the *development version* on Windows or MacOS, is to get it from the [R-universe](https://r-universe.dev/organizations/) repository, like this:

```
install.packages('raster', repos='https://rspatial.r-universe.dev')
```

### From source-code

To install the development version you can do:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("rspatial/raster")
```

If you are on Windows, you need to first install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) to get a C++ compiler that R can use. 

On [rspatial.org](http://rspatial.org/) you can learn about spatial data analysis with R.
